	<h3> About </h3>
	<p> Hi! I’m Rachel Meyer, and I’m a Georgia Tech student from Marietta, Georgia. </p> 
	<p> I am majoring in Literature, Media, and Communication, with a focus in media and communication. I am also minoring in Political Science. </p>
	<p> My skills and interests seem wide-ranging at first glance, but they all stem from my fascination with patterns of function and expression. Some of my root interests include: rhetorical strategies, linguistic patterns, visual patterns, color theory, and music theory. These root interests have led to other more applicable interests and skills, such as: writing, media production, media analysis, linguistics, painting, and singing. </p>
